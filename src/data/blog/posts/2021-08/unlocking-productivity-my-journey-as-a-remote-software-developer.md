My name is Falconiere; I am from Brazil, and I am a software developer.  
I have been working remotely for almost four years, and as a software developer, finding a job to work from home wasn't complicated. In the tech industry, there are a lot of opportunities.

I was so happy when I got my first remote job. The first months were easy. But, after that, I started to feel burnt out because I didnâ€™t know how to manage my free time.

So, this is one of the things we have to care about, as we have more time because we are not on the bus leading with traffic or because now we have a flexible schedule, itâ€™s easy to procrastinate and always work late at night. I have to be honest; after years, it's still complicated for me not to procrastinate, but I have improved a lot. Iâ€™ve created an environment that helps me get the flow of work. Having a dedicated room for work and a routine is essential. I believe this is important for those who want to work from home.

Another thing that changed with the remote job was my financial life. Money is important. Working from home can reduce costs, such as transport and food. Consequently, we will have some funds to invest. I have invested part of my earnings, which makes me feel more confident and secure about my life. For example, I can help my family, have good health insurance, and more.

I talked about money, which is very important, but one of the best things about working from home is that it is stress-free. Seriously, you will sleep better and work out. I just started doing this. Spend time with family and friends, play video games, etc., and improve your health.

There are many benefits to working from home, but of course, there are also challenges. For example, during the pandemic, I got burnt out because I was in the house all the time. Overall, there are more benefits than harms.
