In 2024, I didn't quite achieve my New Year's resolutions like getting rich or hitting the gym (though I did work out consistently!), but I accomplished several meaningful things. Let's dive in.


### My daughter


My daughter was born in June. I never imagined fatherhood would transform my life in so many ways. The feeling I experience each day is beyond words—it's like falling in love over and over with this precious little one. Being a father has made me stronger, more responsible, and infinitely happier. Oh boy, it's truly the best feeling ever.


### Work and Side Projects


In 2024, I rediscovered my love for my profession. After a period of feeling unmotivated and directionless, I found my way back and truly enjoyed my work again! I'm grateful to my teammates for their support.


I launched a project called [codafolks](https://codafolks.com/) (still in progress) and started building several others. These weren't just work projects—they were my passion. I poured my heart and soul into them, and seeing them come to life brought incredible satisfaction.


### Overcoming Depression


Not everything was easy—for 15 years, I battled depression, often doubting I'd ever overcome it. Now, I feel confident sharing this darker chapter because I've finally reached a better place.


I understand depression moves in cycles, and future challenges may come. It was a long, difficult journey with many ups and downs, but I persevered. Through seeking help and trying different treatments, I've made it through. I'm happier than ever, thanks in large part to my wife and daughter.


### Workout


While I haven't reached my ideal physique yet, I've maintained consistency at the gym. I've lost 11 kilograms (now 75 kilograms) and gained muscle. My dream body is within reach.


### New Home


At the end of 2024, we moved to a larger house with more rooms and a beautiful view. I love it here! The space gives me room to be creative and work toward my goals.


### Continuing Good Habits


As 2025 begins, I'm committed to turning my dreams into reality and bringing my projects to life. Here are the habits I'll maintain to achieve my goals:

- I will continue spending quality time with my wife and daughter as much as possible (I wish I could spend much more time with them). I love them so much. ❤️
- I will continue learning to improve my professional, technical, and communication skills.
- I will build better products and help my team to grow at my job.
- I will share more about things beyond my job. I enjoy various activities, such as playing guitar or reading sci-fi books, and I want to share that part of myself.
- I will write more posts for my website.
- I will keep going to the gym and be healthier physically and mentally.

### Goals


Each year, I set goals, and while I don't always achieve them all, that's okay. What matters is persistence—unless a goal is truly impossible. Here are my goals for 2025:

- Make a post for [falconiere.io](http://falconiere.io/) every two weeks.
- Make a post for [codafolks.com](http://codafolks.com/) every month.
- Make at least one project profitable from [codafolks.com](http://codafolks.com/)
- Monetise my YouTube channel.
- Make one international travel.
- Buy a new house.

I know these goals are ambitious, but that's what drives me toward my vision of success.


I could write much more about my projects and personal life in the post, but I will do it later. If you reach out, please let me know what you think. See ya ✌
