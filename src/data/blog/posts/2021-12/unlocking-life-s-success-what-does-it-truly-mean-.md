In my mind, being successful would be like Elon Musk, one of the most influential people in the world, but that’s a stupid thought because I’ll never be like him, and that’s fine.

I used to be frustrated because I felt I wasn’t smart enough to be someone like that. But I realised it’s okay to succeed in the way I can, and I know I am smart.

Being successful is much more than being intelligent or working hard. Most of the time, luck is the key. For example, you may have been born into a wealthy family or have had a unique idea in a time when it didn’t exist. You may have been in the right place at the right time.

Nowadays, with social media, it seems everyone is successful, but not you. People travel, take pictures in known places, and make money. But not everything is real. I know people who are faking it. So don’t believe everything you see on Instagram. People like to create an alternative reality where they are always happy.

Of course, that doesn’t mean you should expect good things from nowhere. So we must go and make it happen. We still have to be intelligent and work hard.

In addition, we should define success ourselves. For example, I determined that I would be successful if I had enough money to stop working at age 35, which is possible. I’ll make it. We don’t need to be Bill Gates or Elon Musk. We can be just ourselves.

It’s good to have someone who inspires you to succeed and be happy. But also, we have to understand where we are and what we can do. In that way, we can be less frustrated. I believe that thought can help us achieve our goals and be successful.
