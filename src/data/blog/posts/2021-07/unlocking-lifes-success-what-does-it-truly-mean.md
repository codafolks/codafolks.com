  description: "Success is personal and not solely defined by intelligence or hard work; luck plays a significant role. It's important to create your own definition of success and not be misled by social media portrayals of happiness. Focus on your goals and recognize your unique path to fulfillment."

In my mind, being successful would be like Elon Musk, one of the most influential people in the world, but that’s a stupid thought because I’ll never be like him, and that’s fine.


I used to be frustrated because I felt I wasn’t smart enough to be someone like that. But I realised it’s okay to succeed in the way I can, and I know I am smart.


Being successful is much more than being intelligent or working hard. Most of the time, luck is the key. For example, you may have been born into a wealthy family or had a unique idea when it didn’t exist. You may have been in the right place at the right time.


Nowadays, it seems everyone is successful with social media, but not you. People travel, take pictures in known places, and make money. But not everything is real. I know people who are faking it. So don’t believe everything you see on Instagram. People like to create an alternative reality where they are always happy.


Of course, that doesn’t mean you should expect good things from nowhere. So we must go and make it happen. We still have to be intelligent and work hard.


In addition, we should define success ourselves. For example, I determined that I would be successful if I had enough money to stop working at age 35, which is possible. I’ll make it. We don’t need to be Bill Gates or Elon Musk. We can be just ourselves.


Having someone who inspires you to succeed and be happy is good. However, we must also understand where we are and what we can do. That way, we can be less frustrated. I believe that thinking can help us achieve our goals and be successful.
